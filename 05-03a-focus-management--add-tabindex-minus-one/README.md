# What is negative tabindex

A *negative value* (the exact negative value doesn't actually matter, usually `tabindex="-1"`) means that the element is not reachable via sequential keyboard navigation.

**Note:** `tabindex="-1"` may be useful for elements that should not be navigated to directly using the Tab key, but need to have keyboard focus set to them.
